# MERN-Stack-Project
Created a Blog using MERN Stack with API connections and even has frontend for it.
Instruction:
1. Used POSTMAN app for API connection and backend checking
2. Used MongoDB Atlas for database
3. Also create a folder for every code
4. create a .env file to save your MongoDB username and password, and OPEN_API secret key as I have used it for generating bio for the blog.
